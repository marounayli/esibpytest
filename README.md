## Objective

Application to unit test python code in an exam environment, without having access to the test cases and at the same time returning the number of successful tests to the users.



## Requirements

<ul>
    <li> Python3
    <li> Tkinter
</ul>


## Known Issues and Bugs:

When the bugs are fixed, please erase the issue from the list


## To implement:

Figure out a way to imbed HTML and CSS in tkinter so that most of the UI is created using those.

We need better styling

We also need an efficient way to generate and evaluate test cases so that no source code modification is required when creating new exams
